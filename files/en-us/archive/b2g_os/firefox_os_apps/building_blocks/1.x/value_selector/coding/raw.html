<p>Here you can find examples of how to create <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/UX/Building_blocks/Value_selector" title="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/UX/Building_blocks/Toolbar">value selectors</a> on Firefox OS, as well as downloads for the CSS and image resources used by the built-in apps on Firefox OS. You can copy these resources into your app and make use of them to build apps that match these apps' appearances.</p>

<h2 id="Implementing_value_selectors">Implementing value selectors</h2>

<p>To implement a toolbar using the style shown here, place the CSS and media files into your app and then import the CSS using the <!-- {{cssxref("@import")}} --> at-rule:</p>

<pre class="brush: css">@import url(resources/value_selector.css);</pre>

<p>Make sure the media files are in the location expected by the CSS (either by placing them in a corresponding location or by revising the CSS).</p>
