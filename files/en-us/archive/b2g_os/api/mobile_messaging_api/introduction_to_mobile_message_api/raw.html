<h2 id="Summary">Summary</h2>

<p>A part of the core functionality in a mobile phone is sending and receiving SMS and MMS messages. This is achieved through the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/sysapps/messaging/" title="http://www.w3.org/2012/sysapps/messaging/">Messaging API</a>. As this new specification is in its early stage, Firefox OS implements a non-standard version of this. Here is a little overview of that API as implemented.</p>

<p>The main entry point for that API is the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/mozMobileMessage" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>navigator.mozMobileMessage</code></a> object which is an instance of <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozMobileMessageManager" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>MozMobileMessageManager</code></a>. It allows to perform all the managing actions required to manipulate SMS and MMS messages.</p>

<h2 id="Sending_messages">Sending messages</h2>

<h3 id="SMS">SMS</h3>

<p>An SMS is basically a text made of 160 characters. So to send an SMS it just requires to call the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozMobileMessageManager/send" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>MozMobileMessageManager.send()</code></a> method with the appropriate text and the phone number of the recipient for the message.</p>

<pre class="brush: js;">var message = "Hi!";
var number = "1234"; // There are several ways to retrieve a valid phone number

navigator.mozMobileMessage.send(number, message);
</pre>

<p>However, there are some tricky rules regarding the size of an SMS, so before sending any message, it's considered best practice to check for the right size of your message. If your message is too long, you have to split it into segments and send a different SMS for each segment. To deal with that sizing issue, you just have to use the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozMobileMessageManager/getSegmentInfoForText" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>MozMobileMessageManager.getSegmentInfoForText()</code></a> which returns a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozSmsSegmentInfo" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>MozSmsSegmentInfo</code></a> object.</p>

<pre class="brush: js;">// Assuming `message` and `number` variables

var info = navigator.mobileMessage.getSegmentInfoForText(message);
var msg  = "";
var pos  = 0;
var size = 0;

for (var i = 0; i &lt; info.segments; i++) {
  pos  = i * info.charsPerSegment;
  size = i &lt; info.segments - 1
       ? info.charsPerSegment
       : info.charsAvailableInLastSegment;

  msg = message.substr(pos, size);

  navigator.mozMobileMessage.send(number, msg);
}
</pre>

<p>Once the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozMobileMessageManager/send" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>send</code></a> method is called, it returns a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMRequest" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>DOMRequest</code></a> to handle the <code>success</code> or <code>error</code> of the sending operation. It's possible to send an SMS to more than one recipient at a time. To do so, it just requires to pass an <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array" title="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array">Array</a></code> of strings instead of a single string to the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozMobileMessageManager/send" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>send</code></a> method. In that case, the method returns an <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array" title="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array">Array</a></code> of <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMRequest" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>DOMRequest</code></a>, each of them allowing to handle the <code>success</code> or <code>error</code> of the sending process for each recipient.</p>

<p>In all cases, if the request is successful, the request's <code>result</code> is a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozSmsMessage" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>MozSmsMessage</code></a> object.</p>

<pre class="brush: js;">// Assuming `message`is a string and `numbers` an Array of strings

var request, msg, pos, size, i,
    info = navigator.mobileMessage.getSegmentInfoForText(message);

for (i = 0; i &lt; info.segments; i++) {
  pos  = i * info.charsPerSegment;
  size = i &lt; info.segments - 1
       ? info.charsPerSegment
       : info.charsAvailableInLastSegment;

  msg = message.substr(pos, size);

  requests = navigator.mozMobileMessage.send(numbers, msg);

  requests.forEach(function (request) {
    request.onsuccess = function () {
      console.log('The SMS has been sent to ' + this.result.receiver)
    }

    request.onerror = function () {
      console.log('Something goes wrong: ' + this.error)
    }
  });
}
</pre>

<h3 id="MMS">MMS</h3>

<p>MMS messages are a bit harder to manage because their content is not plain text but a full <a href="http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/" title="http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/">SMIL</a> document. Once you have managed to build such a document, it can be sent with the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozMobileMessageManager/sendMMS" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>MozMobileMessageManager.sendMMS()</code></a> method. It expects a parameter object that will provide all the necessary information about the MMS. This object expects the following properties:</p>

<ul>
 <li><code>receivers</code> : An Array of strings; each string is the phone number of a receiver for the message.</li>
 <li><code>subject</code> : A string representing the subject of the message.</li>
 <li><code>smil</code> : The stringified SMIL document representing the MMS's content.</li>
 <li><code>attachments</code> : The necessary assets required by the MMS (for example: images, videos, text, etc.) Each asset is a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob" title="A Blob object represents a file-like object of immutable, raw data. Blobs represent data that isn't necessarily in a JavaScript-native format. The File interface is based on Blob, inheriting blob functionality and expanding it to support files on the user's system."><code>Blob</code></a> object.</li>
</ul>

<pre class="brush: js;">// Assuming `file` is a Blob representing an image
// Assuming `numbers` is an Array of strings representing phone numbers

var message = {
  receivers: numbers,
  subject: "Pic from my wedding"
  smil: '&lt;smil&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;par&gt;' +
        '&lt;img src="wedding.jpg" /&gt;' +
        '&lt;text src="txt" /&gt;' +
        '&lt;/par&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/smil&gt;',
  attachments: [
    {
      location: 'txt',
      content : new Blob(['Me and my wife'], {type: 'text/plain'})
    },
    {
      location: 'wedding.jpg',
      content : file
    }
  ]
}

navigator.mozMobileMessage.sendMMS(message);
</pre>

<p>Whether you send an MMS to one or many recipients, the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozMobileMessageManager/sendMMS" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>sendMMS</code></a> method always returns one single <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMRequest" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>DOMRequest</code></a> object to handle the success or error of the sending operation. In case of success, the request's <code>result</code> is a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozMmsMessage" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>MozMmsMessage</code></a> which provides information about the success of the sending to each recipient through its <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozMmsMessage/deliveryStatus" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>deliveryStatus</code></a> property.</p>

<h3 id="Sending_workflow">Sending workflow</h3>

<p>Each time a message is sent, it enters an ending workflow. This workflow will send events in order to track it and to react to any change in this workflow.</p>

<ol>
 <li><code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/sending" title="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/sending">sending</a></code> : the message has entered the sending workflow.</li>
 <li><code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/sent" title="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/sent">sent</a></code> : the message has been sent to the recipients<br>
  or <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/failed" title="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/failed">failed</a></code> if something goes wrong.</li>
 <li><code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/deliverysuccess" title="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/deliverysuccess">deliverysuccess</a></code> : the message has been received by a recipient<br>
  or <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/deliveryerror" title="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/deliveryerror">deliveryerror</a></code> if the recipient was unable to get the message.</li>
</ol>

<p>It's possible to listen for those events at the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozMobileMessageManager" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>MozMobileMessageManager</code></a> level with the basic <code>on*</code> properties or through the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener" title="The EventTarget.addEventListener() method adds the specified EventListener-compatible object to the list of event listeners for the specified event type on the EventTarget on which it is called. The event target may be an Element in a document, the Document itself, a Window, or any other object that supports events (such as XMLHttpRequest)."><code>addEventListener</code></a> method. The callback functions used as event handler will get a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozSmsEvent" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>MozSmsEvent</code></a> or <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozMmsEvent" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>MozMmsEvent</code></a> as input parameter.</p>

<pre class="brush: js;">navigator.mozMobileMessage.addEventListener('sending', function (e) {
  console.log("Queueing a message to be sent to: " + (e.message.receiver || e.message.receivers));
});

navigator.mozMobileMessage.addEventListener('sent', function (e) {
  console.log("Message sent to: " + (e.message.receiver || e.message.receivers));
});

navigator.mozMobileMessage.addEventListener('failed', function (e) {
  console.log("Unable to send a message to: " + (e.message.receiver || e.message.receivers));
});

navigator.mozMobileMessage.addEventListener('deliverysuccess', function (e) {
  console.log("Message received by: " + (e.message.receiver || e.message.receivers));
});

navigator.mozMobileMessage.addEventListener('deliveryerror', function (e) {
  console.log("Message NOT received by: " + (e.message.receiver || e.message.receivers));
});
</pre>

<h2 id="Receiving_messages">Receiving messages</h2>

<p>Each time the device receives a message, it will enter a retrieving workflow. This workflow will send events in order to track it and to react to any change in this workflow.</p>

<ol>
 <li><code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/retrieving" title="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/retrieving">retrieving</a></code> : A message has entered the retrieving workflow (this event only occurs for MMS as they have to be downloaded and it can take a significant amount of time, depending on the assets of the message).</li>
 <li><code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/received" title="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/received">received</a></code> : A message has been received.</li>
</ol>

<p>It's possible to listen for those events at the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozMobileMessageManager" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>MozMobileMessageManager</code></a> level with the basic <code>on*</code> properties or through the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener" title="The EventTarget.addEventListener() method adds the specified EventListener-compatible object to the list of event listeners for the specified event type on the EventTarget on which it is called. The event target may be an Element in a document, the Document itself, a Window, or any other object that supports events (such as XMLHttpRequest)."><code>addEventListener</code></a> method. The callback functions used as event handler will get a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozSmsEvent" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>MozSmsEvent</code></a> or <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozMmsEvent" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>MozMmsEvent</code></a> as input parameter.</p>

<p>At that point, you are able to do whatever you want with those messages (note that SMS, for example, has handling rules defined through their <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozSmsMessage/messageClass" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>messageClass</code></a> property). However, they are automatically stored on the device and can be retrieved (see below).</p>

<h2 id="Handling_messages">Handling messages</h2>

<h3 id="Accessing_messages">Accessing messages</h3>

<p>There are several ways of accessing the messages stored on the device.</p>

<p>To get a single known message, it's possible to use the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozMobileMessageManager/getMessage" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>MozMobileMessageManager.getMessage()</code></a> for SMS or <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozMobileMessageManager/retrieveMMS" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>MozMobileMessageManager.retrieveMMS()</code></a> for MMS.</p>

<p>To access a list of messages, it can be done with the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozMobileMessageManager/getMessages" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>MozMobileMessageManager.getMessages()</code></a> method. This method expects a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozSmsFilter" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>MozSmsFilter</code></a> as its first parameter (despite its name, this object is also used to filter MMS messages). Such an object is used to define filtering parameters. It allows to filter messages by date, read status, recipients, delivery status, or thread (messages are stored by discussion thread in order to make such recovering easier. All threads can be accessed with the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozMobileMessageManager/getThreads" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>MozMobileMessageManager.getThreads()</code></a> method.)</p>

<pre class="brush: js;">// In this example we want to access all the messages of the thread related to an incoming message

navigator.mozMobileMessage.addEventListener('received', function (msg) {
  var threadId = msg.threadId;

  var filter = new MozSmsFilter();
  filter.threadId = threadId;

  // Get the messages from the latest to the first
  var cursor = navigator.mozMobileMessage.getMessages(filter, true);

  cursor.onsuccess = function () {
    var message = this.result;
    var time = message.timestamp.toDateString()

    console.log(time + ': ' + (message.body || message.subject)); // SMS || MMS

    if (!this.done) {
      this.continue();
    }
  }
});
</pre>

<h3 id="Other_actions">Other actions</h3>

<ul>
 <li>deleting messages via <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozMobileMessageManager/delete" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>MozMobileMessageManager.delete()</code></a>.</li>
 <li>changing the read/unread state of a message via <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozMobileMessageManager/markMessageRead" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>MozMobileMessageManager.markMessageRead()</code></a>.</li>
