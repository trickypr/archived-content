<p class="summary"><span class="seoSummary">As part of your app's Compatibility and Payments options, it's possible to identify a paid app as a premium upgrade to a free one, which is then promoted in Firefox Marketplace. This option enables you to offer users the ability to try a restricted version of the app before buying the full version, offer a free version with ads and a paid one without, or similar combinations. This page explains how to use the setting and how the upgrade information is presented in Firefox Marketplace.</span></p>

<p>At the bottom of the <strong>Compatibility &amp; Pricing</strong> page you'll find the <strong>Promote as upgrade to free version</strong> section. In the <strong>This is a paid upgrade of</strong> box you can select one of your free apps for which the current app is a paid upgrade. Once you've selected the appropriate free app, click <strong>Save Changes</strong>.</p>
