<p><span class="seoSummary">Bango is the payment provider for credit card and operator payment transactions on Firefox Marketplace. To receive payments for app and in-app purchases processed by Bango you'll need to create at least one Bango payment account. This page provides a guide to the account creation process.</span></p>

<p>When you submit your first paid app you'll need to add a Bango account so that users can purchase your app and you can receive payments of your revenue. This process is described in <a href="/en-US/Marketplace/Publishing/Pricing/Providers/Bango#Your_first_paid_app">Your first paid app</a>.</p>

<p>For the second and all subsequent paid apps that you submit you'll have the choice between using an existing Bango account or creating a new one. The processes associated with these options are described in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Marketplace/Publishing/Pricing/Providers/Bango#Your_second_or_later_paid_apps">Your second or later paid apps</a>.</p>
