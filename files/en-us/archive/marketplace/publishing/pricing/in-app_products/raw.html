<p><strong><code>fxPay</code> is currently an experimental API</strong>. Only consider using this library if you want to help us iron out bugs and don't mind dealing with API changes. For more information see <a href="/en-US/Marketplace/Monetization/In-app_payments_section/fxPay_iap">In-app Payments with fxPay</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockIndicator note">
<p>Do not use this page to create in-app product details for use with <code>mozPay</code>. Such in-app products need to be created on your own server. See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Marketplace/Monetization/In-app_payments_section/mozPay_iap#Set_up_your_server_to_sign_JWTs">here</a> for more details.</p>

<p>On this page you define the products your app will sell using the fxpay API. Initially the page offers a button to add a product.</p>

<p><img alt='Prior to creating any in-app products the In-app Products page offer an "Add a product" button.' src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8769/In_app_products_initial.png" style="height: 262px; width: 730px;"></p>

<p>To add a new product, click <strong>Add a product</strong>.</p>

<p><img alt="Setup in-app products for use with fxpay by defining a product icon, name and price point. You can also define whether the item is active or inactive." src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8771/In_app_products_entry.png" style="height: 242px; width: 730px;"></p>

<p>For each product you define:</p>

<ul>
 <li>an icon. The icon defaults to the one you've specified for your app. You can replace it with a product specific icon by clicking the icon and providing the URL of the new icon.<br>
  <img alt="To replace the app icon for an in-app product you need to specify the URL for the new icon." src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8773/In_app_products_icon_urll.png" style="height: 184px; width: 284px;"><br>
  Note that if you click the icon but then don't provide a URL (click Cancel in the popup), the icon is hidden and you cannot change it. To recover the default icon, refresh the page and click <strong>Add a product</strong> again. For more information, see <!-- <!-- {{bug(1078112)}} --> -->.</li>
 <li>a product name.</li>
 <li>a product price point, which you select from the dropdown list.</li>
</ul>

<p>By default a new product is enabled, but you can choose to disable it. Once the details are complete, click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>

<p>The product is now given an ID and you can continue adding more in-app products or edit details of existing products.</p>

<p><img alt="Once an in-app product has been saved its given a unique ID and you have the option to edit in-app products or add more." src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8775/In_app_products_entred.png" style="height: 243px; width: 728px;"></p>

<p>You can edit any details of an in-app product, but its ID remains unchanged.</p>
