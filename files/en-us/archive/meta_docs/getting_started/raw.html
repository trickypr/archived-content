<p>The <strong>Mozilla Developer Network</strong> (MDN) is a wiki, where <strong>anyone</strong> can add and edit content. You don't need to be a programmer or an expert on the latest technology. There is a wide range of tasks that need to be done, ranging from the simple, such as proofreading and correcting typos, to the more complex, like writing API documentation.</p>

<p>If you are a new contributor to MDN, you will probably have questions! This article will help you get started.</p>

<h2 id="Contribution_made_simple">Contribution made simple</h2>

<p>Contributing is easy and safe. If you make a mistake, it can be easily fixed. Even if you don't know exactly how things should look, or if your grammar isn't all that great, don't worry about it! We have an experienced team of people whose job is to make sure that MDN's content is as strong as possible. Someone will be along to make sure your work is well written.</p>

<p>You don't require any special permission to contribute, either. As soon as you sign up for an MDN account,<strong> you're ready to start writing or editing. It's that simple.</strong> As said above, if you have questions or would like some help, you should <a href="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/About#The_MDN_community" title="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/About#The_MDN_community">join our online community </a>and chat with us about it!
