 <p>If you're unsure as to whether your app meets the low-memory requirements, you can find more details in the article <a href="/en-US/Apps/Build/Performance/Apps_for_low-memory_Firefox_OS_devices">Apps for low-memory Firefox OS devices</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>When you submit an app to Marketplace it's initially excluded from the list of apps shown to users of low-memory devices, such as the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/devices/#intex_cloudfx">Cloud FX</a> and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/devices/#spice_fireonemifx1">Spice Fire One MI FX1</a>. If you believe your app meets the memory requirements for low-memory phones, you can request a review by clicking Request a low-memory review.</p>
<p><img alt="In this section you request a review of your app against the criteria for low-memory devices." src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8687/Low_memory_device_review.png" style="width: 790px; height: 285px;"></p>
<p>The Low-Memory Devices section is now updated to show when you made your review request.</p>
<p><img alt="Once a review has been requested the section is updated to indicate when you made the request." src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8701/Low_memory_device_review-%20submitted.png" style="width: 790px; height: 207px;"></p>
<p>(Further details on the process to be provided).</p>
