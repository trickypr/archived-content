<dl>
 <dt><code>none</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Initial value. Indicates that zooming is unaffected by any defined snap-points. After the contact is picked up, the content will continue to move with inertia.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>proximity </code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Indicates that the motion of the content after the contact is picked up <em>may</em> be adjusted if the content would normally stop "close enough" to a snap-point. This implies that it is possible for the content zoom factor to end up between snap-points.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>mandatory </code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Indicates that the motion of the content after the contact is picked up is <em>always</em> adjusted so that it lands on a snap-point. The snap-point that is selected is the one that is closest to where the content zoom factor would normally stop.</p>

<p>This property has no effect on non-zoomable elements. See <!-- <!-- {{CSSXRef("-ms-content-zooming")}} --> --> for details on zoomable elements.</p>

<p>When a user pans or scrolls and then lifts his or her contact (for instance, a finger), the content can continue to move with inertia. Snap-points can change the animation that runs when the user lifts his or her finger so that you can adjust where the content will stop. By placing snap-points, you can make it easy for your users to manipulate your content and make it stop at convenient or key places.</p>

<p>Starting with Windows 8.1, this property is also supported for touchpad interaction.</p>

<p>This property requires Windows  or later.</p>
