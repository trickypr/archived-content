<h2 id="Status_of_this_document" name="Status_of_this_document">Status of this document</h2>

<p>This document is to be considered of historical interest only. As of <a href="/en-US/docs/XPCOM/XPCOM_changes_in_Gecko_2.0" title="XPCOM/XPCOM_changes_in_Gecko_2.0">Gecko 2.0</a> (Firefox 4), all interfaces are subject to change at all times, and there is no longer a concept of a "frozen interface".</p>



<h2 id="Interfaces_and_XPCOM_Components:_An_overview" name="Interfaces_and_XPCOM_Components:_An_overview">Interfaces and XPCOM Components: An overview</h2>

<p>Mozilla's applications are written as a set of XPCOM Components that provide functionality to the application, and a bunch of <a href="/en-US/docs/XUL" title="XUL">XUL</a>, DTD, and <a href="/en-US/docs/JavaScript" title="JavaScript">JavaScript</a> that provide the User Interface (UI).</p>

<p><a href="/en-US/docs/Creating_XPCOM_Components" title="Creating_XPCOM_Components">XPCOM Components</a> are exposed to the world by means of interfaces.</p>

<p><a href="/en-US/docs/Creating_XPCOM_Components/An_Overview_of_XPCOM" title="Creating_XPCOM_Components/An_Overview_of_XPCOM">Interfaces</a> describe portions of the functionality provided by XPCOM Components, and are written using an <a href="/en-US/docs/XPIDL" title="XPIDL">Interface Description Language</a> (IDL).</p>




<h2 id="Frozen_Interfaces" name="Frozen_Interfaces">Frozen Interfaces</h2>

<p>As of <!-- {{ gecko("2") }} --> interfaces will no longer be frozen. See <a href="/en-US/docs/XPCOM/XPCOM_changes_in_Gecko_2.0" title="XPCOM/XPCOM_changes_in_Gecko_2.0">XPCOM changes in Gecko 2.0</a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Firefox_4_for_developers" title="Firefox_4_for_developers">Firefox 4 for developers</a> for details.</p>

<p>As Mozilla evolves, some interfaces (its IDL) are changed. However this procedure has some side effects:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You must change the implementation of the component in order to comply with changes in the interfaces.</li>
  <li>Clients using components must change accordingly</li>
</ol>

<p>This might not seem to be a huge problem, but as developers make new extensions (or other contributions) they must rely in the stability of the interfaces they are using in their works. So we need a mechanism to provide such a confidence.</p>

<p>The Mozilla team has provided such a mechanism by declaring an interface that is not going to be changed anymore as <strong>frozen</strong>. This means that everybody can trust that a frozen interface will not be changed, so they can use it as they please: both to implement a component providing such functionality or using a component through that interface.</p>

<p>Non-frozen (sometimes called unfrozen) interfaces are likely to be changed and developers using them in any way must watch for changes in order to adapt their works. Hopefully, non-frozen interfaces can go frozen without changes.</p>

<p>Mozilla keeps track of the <a href="/en-US/docs/Interfaces" title="Interfaces">current list of interfaces</a> and their status.</p>
