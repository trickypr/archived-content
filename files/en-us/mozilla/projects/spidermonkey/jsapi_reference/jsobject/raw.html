<p><strong><code>JSObject</code></strong> is the type of JavaScript objects in the JSAPI.</p>
</div>
<p>Objects are made up of the following parts:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Most objects have a <em>prototype</em>. See <!-- <!-- {{jsapixref("JS_GetPrototype")}} --> -->. An object inherits properties, including methods, from its prototype (which is another object).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 <li>Most objects have a <em>parent</em>. See <!-- <!-- {{jsapixref("JS_GetParent")}} --> -->. An object's parent is another object, usually either the global object or an object that represents an activation record. The JavaScript engine sometimes uses this relationship to implement lexical scoping. Security-sensitive applications can use this relationship to make every object a member of some security domain.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 <li>Almost every object can have any number of its own properties. The term <em>own property</em> refers to a property of an object that is not inherited from its prototype. Each property has a name, a getter, a setter, and <!-- <!-- {{jsapixref("JS_GetPropertyAttributes", "property attributes", "", 1)}} --> -->. Most properties also have a <!-- <!-- {{jsapixref("Stored_value", "stored value", "", 1)}} --> -->. See <!-- <!-- {{jsapixref("JS_DefineProperty")}} --> -->.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 <li>Every object is associated with a <!-- <!-- {{jsapixref("JSClass")}} --> --> and a <!-- <!-- {{jsapixref("JSObjectOps")}} --> -->. These are C/C++ hooks and metadata that govern various aspects of the object's behavior and describe its layout in memory.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 <li>Depending on the <code>JSClass</code>, an object may have a <!-- <!-- {{jsapixref("JS_SetPrivate", "private data pointer", "", 1)}} --> --> and any number of <!-- <!-- {{jsapixref("JS_SetReservedSlot", "reserved slots", "", 1)}} --> -->.</li>
</ul>
