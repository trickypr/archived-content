<p>SpiderMonkey bytecodes are the canonical form of code representation that is used in the JavaScript engine. The JavaScript frontend constructs an AST from the source text, then emits stack-based bytecodes from that AST as a part of the JSScript data structure. Bytecodes can reference atoms and objects (typically by array index) which are also contained in the JSScript data structure.</p>
<p>Within the engine, all bytecode execute within a stack frame -- even global (top-level) and eval code has a stack frame associated with it. A frame on the stack has space for JavaScript Values (the tagged value format) in a few different categories. The space for a single JavaScript value is called a "slot", so the categories are:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Argument slots: holds the actual arguments passed to the current frame.</li>
 <li>Local slots: holds the local variables used by the current code.</li>
 <li>Expression slots: holds the temporary space that you need to calculate expressions on a stack. For example, in <code>(a + b) + c</code> you would push a, then push b, then add, then push c, then add, which requires a maximum depth of two expression slots.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also some slots reserved for dedicated functionality, holding values like <code>this</code> and the callee / return value.</p>
<p>There is always a "Top of Stack" (TOS) that corresponds to the latest value pushed onto the expression stack. All bytecodes implicitly operate in terms of this location.</p>

<p>All opcodes are annotated with a [-popcount, +pushcount] to represent the overall stack-effects their execution.</p>
