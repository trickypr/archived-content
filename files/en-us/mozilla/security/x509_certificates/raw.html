<p><span class="seoSummary">X.509 (in this document referred as x509) is an ITU standard to describe certificates. This article provides an overview of what these are and how they work.</span></p>

<p>Three versions of the x509 standard have been defined for web-pki. In this document we will be referring to the current standard in use for web pki: x509 v3, which is described in detail in <!-- <!-- {{rfc(5280)}} --> -->. In general, x509 certificates bind a signature to a validity period, a public key, a subject, an issuer, and a set of extensions. The extensions define extra properties of the certificate such as extra attributes of the certificate or constraints on the use of the certificate. In order for a certificate to be valid these three requirements must be met:</p>

<ol>
 <li>There is a verification path from the site certificate to a trusted certificate of the user agent (ie if you follow the issuer path you will end on a self-signed certificate that is considered trusted by the browser).</li>
 <li>The attributes of the certificates in the verification path have valid parameters for that verification (for example the validity period of all the certificates are valid for the time the verification is being done)</li>
 <li>Revocation checks are considered OK for that particular validation.</li>
</ol>

<p>One issue that is not commonly known is that the x509 trust graph is not a forest (a bunch of trees where each root is a trusted root) but a cyclic graph, where the same key/issuer can be a root or an intermediate for another root in the browsers key store (when roots create intermediates for each other it is called cross-signing).</p>

<h2 id="Extensions_2"><span class="mw-headline" id="Extensions">Extensions</span></h2>

<p>While <!-- <!-- {{rfc(5280)}} --> --> defines 16 extensions for webpki in this document we will be describing the six extensions we considered critical for understanding. Certificates can have other extensions not described on <!-- <!-- {{rfc(5280)}} --> -->, but that is out of the scope of this document. Extensions can be marked as critical or non-critical, conforming certificate verification libraries should stop processing verification when encountering a critical extension that they do not understand ( and should continue processing if the extension is marked as non-critical) mozila::pkix has this behavior.</p>

<h3 id="Subject_alternate_name"><span class="mw-headline" id="Subject_Alternate_Name">Subject alternate name</span></h3>

<p>This extension defines what other names (such as DNS names) are valid for this certificate. This allows for a certificate to be used for more than one <a class="external text" href="http://www.tech-faq.com/fqdn.html" rel="nofollow">FQDN</a>, for example you can have a certificate that is valid for both a.example.com and b.example.com</p>

<h3 id="Basic_constraints"><span class="mw-headline" id="Basic_Constraints">Basic constraints</span></h3>

<p>This allows certificates to be asserted as issuing certificates (it is mandatory for CA certificates). It can also be used to express the maximum depth of the trust path from the CA.</p>

<h3 id="Key_usage"><span class="mw-headline" id="Key_Usage">Key usage</span></h3>

<p>This extension is used to constrain the purpose for the key in the certificate. More than one key usage can be asserted. Examples of key usages are: <code>digitalSignature</code>, <code>keyEncipherment</code>, <code>dataEncipherment</code>, <code>keyCertSign</code>, and <code>cRLSign</code>. For CA certificates the <code>keyCertSign</code> bit <strong>must</strong> be set.</p>

<h3 id="Extended_key_usages"><span class="mw-headline" id="Extended_Key_Usages">Extended key usages</span></h3>

<p>This is another bitfield to constrain the usages of the key of the certificate. Its is directed mostly at what type of application the certificate was issued for. Examples of extended key usages are: <code>serverAuth</code>, <code>clientAuth</code>, and <code>OCSPSigning</code>. For end-entity certificates for PKI this extension is required to exist with the <code>serverAuth</code> bit asserted.</p>

<h3 id="Name_constraints"><span class="mw-headline" id="Name_Constraints">Name constraints</span></h3>

<p>This is an extension exclusive for CA and indicates limits on the name space for its children. This is one of the most powerful extensions for businesses to have to help limit risk imposed by losing the private key of the CA.</p>

<h3 id="Authority_information_access"><span class="mw-headline" id="Authority_Information_Access">Authority information access</span></h3>

<p>This extension is primarily used to to describe the OCSP location for revocation checking. It is mandatory for certificates that chain up to a root in the Mozilla CA program.</p>

<h2 id="Self-signed_certificates"><span class="mw-headline" id="Self_Signed_Certs">Self-signed certificates</span></h2>

<p>These are the steps to generate a certificate for www.example.com. Replace this value with the actual server name in the steps below.<br>
 1. Generate the key using the following command:</p>

<ul>
 <li><code>openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048</code></li>
 <li>2048 is considered secure for the next 4 years.</li>
</ul>

<dl>
</dl>

<p>2. Generate CSR using this command:</p>

<ul>
 <li><code>openssl req -new -key key.pem -days 1096 -extensions v3_ca -batch -out example.csr -utf8 -subj '/CN=www.example.com'</code></li>
 <li>This creates a new Certificate Signing Request (CSR) that will be valid for 3 years.</li>
</ul>

<dl>
</dl>

<p>3. Write extensions file by creating a new file with name <code>openssl.ss.cnf</code> with the following contents:</p>

<ul>
 <li>basicConstraints = CA:FALSE</li>
 <li>subjectAltName =DNS:www.example.com</li>
 <li>extendedKeyUsage =serverAuth</li>
</ul>

<dl>
</dl>

<p>4. Self-sign csr (using SHA256) and append the extensions described in the file</p>

<ul>
 <li>"openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 3650 -in example.csr -signkey key.pem -set_serial $ANY_INTEGER -extfile openssl.ss.cnf -out example.pem"</li>
</ul>

<dl>
</dl>

<p>You can now use example.pem as your certfile</p>

<h2 id="CAs_included_in_Firefox"><span class="mw-headline" id="CAs_Included_in_Firefox">CAs included in Firefox</span></h2>

<p>When you visit a secure website, Firefox will validate the websiteâ€™s certificate by checking that the certificate that signed it is valid, and checking that the certificate that signed the parent certificate is valid and so forth up to a root certificate that is known to be valid. This chain of certificates is called the Certificate Hierarchy.</p>

<p>If your certificates will only be used to verify one domain (e.g. *.yourcompany.com) but you want others outside of your organization to be able to browse to your website using https without having to manually import a root certificate, then you can get an SSL certificate from one of the CAs who already have a root certificate included in the major browsers.</p>

<p>Firefox uses a default set of X.509v3 root certificates for various <a class="external text" href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/included/" rel="nofollow">Certification Authorities (CAs)</a>. The root certificates included by default have their "trust bits" set to indicate if the CA's root certificates may be used to verify certificates for SSL servers, S/MIME email users, and/or digitally-signed code objects without having to ask users for further permission or information.</p>

<p>CAs apply to have their root certificates <a class="external text" href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/included/" rel="nofollow">included by default in Mozilla products</a> by following the <a class="external text" href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/policy/" rel="nofollow">Mozilla CA Certificate Policy</a> and applying for inclusion as per <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:How_to_apply" title="CA:How to apply">CA:How_to_apply</a>. Users may override the default root certificate settings using the <a class="external text" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:UserCertDB" rel="nofollow">Certificate Manager</a>.</p>

<p>Some organizations make use of the set of CAs included in Mozilla's products. If you wish to do this, you should read the relevant part of the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:FAQ#Can_I_use_Mozilla.27s_set_of_CA_certificates.3F">Mozilla CA FAQ</a> before doing so.</p>

<h2 id="Running_your_Own_CA_2"><span class="mw-headline" id="Running_your_Own_CA">Running your Own CA</span></h2>

<p>If you are going to have your own CA, we recommend building 3 certificates: a long term root cert, a medium term intermediate cert, and a short term end-entity cert. This type of hierarchy allows for a relatively simple long term root to be distributed to clients, and some flexibility on the intermediate cert so that you can change parameters based on best practices and security research.</p>

<h2 id="Generate_your_CA_Root_2"><span class="mw-headline" id="Generate_your_CA_Root">Generate your CA Root</span></h2>

<p>Update *.example.com and *.example.net below to match your domains.</p>

<p>Assumptions:</p>

<ul>
 <li>You are the domain owner of *.example.com and *.example.net.</li>
 <li>Your computer is <strong>not</strong> connected to the internet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Steps to generate your CA root certificate:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Generate key
  <ul>
   <li>"openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out rootkey.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096"</li>
   <li>4096 is considered secure for the next 15 years.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Generate csr
  <ul>
   <li>"openssl req -new -key rootkey.pem -days 5480 -extensions v3_ca -batch -out root.csr -utf8 -subj '/C=US/O=Orgname/OU=SomeInternalName'</li>
   <li>Make a new Certificate Signing Request (CSR) that will be valid for 15 years.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Write extensions File (openssl.root.cnf)
  <ul>
   <li>basicConstraints = critical, CA:TRUE</li>
   <li>keyUsage = keyCertSign, cRLSign</li>
   <li>subjectKeyIdentifier = hash</li>
   <li>nameConstraints = permitted;DNS:example.com,permitted;DNS:example.net</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Self-sign csr (using SHA256) and append the extensions described in the file
  <ul>
   <li>"openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 3650 -in root.csr -signkey rootkey.pem -set_serial $ANY_SMALL_INTEGER -extfile openssl.root.cnf -out root.pem"</li>

<p>There are several organizations that provide recommendations regarding the security parameters for key/hash sizes given current computational power.

<p>In other words, SHA1 is now deprecated for new uses. We should use at least 3072 key sizes and at least a 256 ECC curve. Thus the recommendation here is for the root to be 4096 if using RSA and p384 for the root key. (p384 also chosen for compatibility as most SSL/TLS implementations support this part of suite B).</p>
