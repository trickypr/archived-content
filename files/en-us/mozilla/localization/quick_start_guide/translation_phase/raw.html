<p>Congratulations on completing the initial setup! As a reward for your efforts, you get to move on to the very reason you've come here: to localize Mozilla projects.</p>

<p>This is where the technical aspect of the process begins to divide. At Mozilla, we localize many different projects that can be categorized into three different groups. Each group of projects employs a different type of l10n tool for, you guessed it, localizing the projects. The l10n tools are meant to help you maintain your localized content from release to release and leverage already localized materials when localizing new content.</p>

<p>Here we'll identify those groups of projects and the l10n tools associated with them. Along the way we'll point you to basic, technical tutorials on localizing for that particular project group. It's up to you and your community to determine which l10n tool will best suit your needs. As you gain more experience, you may want to localize independent of Mozilla-developed l10n tools, which we'll also discuss here.</p>

<h2 id="Projects">Projects</h2>

<p>The Mozilla projects and their l10n workflows are divided into these groups: Mozilla applications, Mozilla websites, and Add-ons. Below you'll find the list of all Mozilla projects, their associated l10n tools, and links to tutorials outlining their workflows.</p>

<h3 id="Mozilla_applications">Mozilla applications</h3>

<p>So you're interested in localizing Mozilla applications. Each l10n tool follows a different workflow for localizing Mozilla application projects. We've linked a brief tutorial to each l10n tool name below. Follow the tutorials to help you decide which l10n tool fits your specific needs.</p>

<p>These are the l10n tools we use to localize Mozilla applications:</p>

<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If your locale has an hg repository hosted on the Mozilla servers, you can track your localization's current progress by visiting the </span><a class="link-https" href="https://l10n.mozilla.org/teams/" title="https://l10n.mozilla.org/teams/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">l10n dashboards</span></a><span style="color: #0000ff;">.</span></p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <span style="color: #ff8c00;">If you are starting a new localization and decide to use an offline tool for localizing Mozilla applications, you will need to become familiar with using Mercurial (hg).

<p>l10n for add-ons is handled by at least two other organizations/services called Babelzilla and Adofex. They both have created comprehensive programs and l10n tools for localizing any and all third-party add-ons for Mozilla applications. Visit their websites to learn how to get involved.</p>

<h2 id="Tool-independent_localization">Tool-independent localization</h2>

<p>Are you a command-line master? Do you prefer Unicode text editors to any other applications on Earth? Do you have a pet CAT (computer-assisted translation) tool, like OmegaT? Then you may not be interested in using any of the tools listed above for your localizations. If that is the case, then this section is for you!</p>

<p>For localizers who prefer localizing without a specialized tool the workflows for localizing Mozilla applications and Mozilla websites are essentially the same.<a href="/en/Localizing_without_a_specialized_tool" title="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Localizing_without_a_specialized_tool"> This tutorial</a> should provide you with all of the technical information you need to secure and maintain your tool independence.</p>

<h2 id="Productization">Productization</h2>

<p>Productization is an essential part of localizing Mozilla products. This is where you research and select the search plugins, content and protocol handlers, bookmarks, and links to recommended sites on the in-product pages that your locale's users will find in their Mozilla products.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Productization_guide" title="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Productization_patches">This tutorial will walk you through performing these productization tasks</a>, creating productization patches, and submitting them for review.</p>
