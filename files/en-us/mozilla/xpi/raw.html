<p><strong>Cross-Platform Installer Module (XPI)</strong> is a ZIP file used to install packages, utilizing the <a href="/en/XPInstall" title="en/XPInstall">XPInstall</a> technology. XPI modules (so called "<a href="/en/Bundles" title="en/Bundles">Bundles</a>") are employed to install a wide variety of software, including <a href="/en/Plugins" title="en/Plugins">Plugins</a>, <a href="/en/Extensions" title="en/Extensions">Extensions</a>, <a href="/en/Themes" title="en/Themes">Themes</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/dictionaries.html">Thunderbird dictionaries</a>.</p>

<p>An XPI contains installation instructions (install.js or <a href="/en/Install_Manifests" title="en/Install_Manifests">install.rdf</a>) as well as the actual software to install, which is often itself packaged as a JAR file. When downloaded or dropped into an extension manager, XPInstall automatically interacts with the installation instructions contained in the XPI, and installs the contained software.</p>

<p>XPI archives only support files stored uncompressed or compressed using the "deflate" method.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Starting in <!-- <!-- {{Gecko("2.0") }} --> -->, XPI files are no longer unpacked when extensions are installed. Instead, the XPI itself is placed in the extensions directory, and files are loaded directly out of the package. See <a href="/en/Extensions/Updating_extensions_for_Firefox_4" title="en/Extensions/Updating extensions for Firefox 4">Updating extensions for Firefox 4</a> for details.</p>
</div>

<p>When XPI files are served via HTTP, the <code>application/x-xpinstall</code> MIME type should be matched with the <code>xpi</code> file extension.</p>
